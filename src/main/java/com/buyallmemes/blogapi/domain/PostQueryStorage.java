            # Hello, world!
            I hate frontend. But at least, I figured out how to use markdown to render content, so I don't have to struggle with WYSIWYG editors, at least now.

            But where was I... Oh yes, **_BLOG_**! I'm building a blog - something you've never heard of or seen before, right? I hope you can read through my sarcasm, I'm using it a lot, and I'm not going to tell you where - figure it out by yourself.

            The idea is simple - share **my** knowledge and opinions on software stuff. And there's no better way to do it, but via examples. So, let's do it!

            I'm going to build a blog, while covering certain aspects of the building process in this blog. So you could see the pattern in action. I'm going to start simple, heck, I'm a backend developer, who claims to be proficient in Java and distributed systems, but I'm writing this in .MD file, which I will copy-paste into a `component` file.

            I want to make this process agile and iterative while doing only what is totally necessary to build what I want now.
            So, for now, it's a single-repo-almost-a-static-page-thingy - https://github.com/buyallmemes/blog.


            Also, I kinda enjoy writing from time to time + I'm a programmer, so why not combine the best of both worlds - create a place where a can park some of my thoughts for good.
